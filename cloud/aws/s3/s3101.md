what is s3?

s3 provides developers with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage. Amz S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web

The basics of s3 are as follows:

* s3 is **object-based**. i.e. allows you to upload files
* files can be from 0Bytes to 5TB
* there is unlimited storage
* files are stored in **Buckets**
* s3 is a universal namespace. That is , names must be **unique globally**. (Because it's actually creating a web address)
* when you upload a file to s3, you will receive a http 200 code if the uplaod was successful to your browser

S3 is object based. Think of objects just as files. Objects consist of the following:

* Key (name of the object)
* value (data)
* version ID
* metadata (data about data)
* subresources: token, access control list, ...
  * torrent: Amazon S3 supports the BitTorrent protocol. Amazon S3 uses the torrent subresource to return the torrent file associated with the specific object.
  * access control list (acl)

How does data constency work for S3?

* Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects: if you make a HEAD or GET request to a key name before the object is created, then create the object shortly after that, a subsequent GET might not return the object due to eventual consistency.

* Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate): until the process is completed, your results might be the older version.

S3 has the folling features:

* tiered storage available
* lifecycle management
* versionning
* encryption
* MFA delete: if a person want to delete a file then multi factor authentification will happen
* secure your data using **access control lists** and **bucket policies**

S3 storage classes

* S3 standard
* S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed): for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retrieval fee
* S3 One Zone - IA: for where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience.
* S3 intelligent Tiering: Desinged to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead
* S3 Glacier: is a secure, durable, low-cost storage class for data archiving and long-term backup. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's lowest cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

Cross region replication

* Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. You can copy objects between different AWS Regions or within the same Region.
* Cross-Region replication (CRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different AWS Regions.

Why use replication

* Replicate objects while retaining metadata: This capability is important if you need to ensure that your replica is identical to the source object
* Replicate objects into different storage classes
* Maintain object copies under different ownership
* Replicate objects within 15 minutes

S3 Transfer Acceleration

* Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket
* Transfer Accelearation takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amz S3 over an optimized network path.

Why Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration?

* You have customers that upload to a centralized bucket from all over the world.

* You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.

* You are unable to utilize all of your available bandwidth over the Internet when uploading to Amazon S3.
